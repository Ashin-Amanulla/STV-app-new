            <h3>How we do it?</h3>
            <p>
              Here at Roehampton, we use a Single Transferable Voting system as
              we feel this is the most representative to our student body. Most
              elections will use the 'First Past The Post' method whereby the
              candidate with the most votes is declared the winner. Using a
              single transferable vote, you are able to select your candidates
              in order of preference, Ranking them from most to least favoured.
              Therefore, your voice is always represented no matter what
              happens. Candidates are required to receive at least 50% of the
              votes cast and if no candidate has received this margin in the
              first round of voting, the candidate with the least votes is
              removed. The votes cast will then be awarded to the person you
              have voted as your second favourite. Candidates will be removed
              and their votes split until a clear majority has been decided for
              one candidate. This means that even if your most favoured
              candidate is removed in the early rounds, your voice is still
              represented and can create an influence on the overall outcome.
